# Custom Read Aloud Plugin

Plugin designed to be used as an audio player/text highlighter alternative to the EPUB readaloud spec in some cases where automatic page-turning is not required. Listens to an audio element, adds a highlight class to elements with a data-attribute value for start time in seconds.

Heavily polyfilled to support e-readers like Adobe Digital Editions.
